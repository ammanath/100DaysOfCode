## Day 2 - Mon, 13 April 2020  
**Today's Progress** :  
Refactored code to create a data structure to hold the text data  
Used the List and its inbuilt funcitons to populate the text card.  

**Thoughts** :    
Spent good amount of time on coding. Have a better understanding of the List and its functions.
