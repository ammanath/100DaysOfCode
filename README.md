## Day 2 - Mon, 13 April 2020  
**Today's Progress** :  
Refactored code to create a data structure to hold the text data  
Used the List and its inbuilt funcitons to populate the text card.  

**Thoughts** :    
Spent good amount of time on coding. Have a better understanding of the List and its functions.  


## Day 3 - Tue, 14 April 2020  
**Today's Progress** :  
Added the Agile Principles. Grouped using a Card for Values and Principles.

#100DaysOfCode  
**Today's Progress** :  
Added a OnTap method on the listview that will show the text details. Added animation to the text.

**Thoughts** :    
The project still works as a Stateless widget.  
Struggling to get this working (compiling and running) on both desktop and laptop. 
Did not get time to read the book or any articles.

## Day 7/100 - Sat, 18 April 2020  #100DaysOfCode  #Flutter  
**Today's Progress** :  
Continued work on list search. 
**Link to work** :

**Thoughts** :   
Found a new widget - scrollable_positioned_list  
Search does not seem to make sense, so removed it  
Changed color to blue  
Need to find a way to navigate easily between cards, will use the app icon - Home and Next.  





## Day 9/100 - Mon, 20 April 2020  #100DaysOfCode  #Flutter
