The most challenging part of the 100 day challenge has been that it only counts the time spent on actually working on the project - on coding. I have struggled to make time to understand the concept or to learn better ways to write code.

I think i need at least 2hrs for learning to make sure i am writing code that is of good quality.  I am averaging good on the weekends , I think the way forward will be to spend the additional time on learning rather than coding on these days.

Proud to have one app on Google Play - though its only on beta (test mode) and making progress on the second app.
